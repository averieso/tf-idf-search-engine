# tf-idf-search-engine

This work is done for the final project of the course Introduction to Python Programming, Winter Semester 2021, University of Saarland.

This is a search engine that reads a corpus from a XML file and returns the most similar documents against a list of query words. The similarity is
calculated based on the tf-idf weighting scheme.

For instructions to run this repository and documentation, see `documentation.pdf`.
